MovieCollection

## Description


The code defines a smart contract named MoviesContract that manages a collection of movies. The contract has a mutable public variable Movies, which is a dictionary mapping movie titles (Strings) to instances of the Movie struct. The Movie struct has attributes such as Title, ReleaseYear, Genre, and Rating. The contract provides an addMovie function for adding new movies to the collection. This contract allows for the creation and management of a decentralized movie database on the Flow blockchain.
